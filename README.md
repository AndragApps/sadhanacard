# SadhanaCard_1

A Flutter project, I did during my graduation at Wellington Institute of technology(Weltec). When I choose to do this project, I have no idea which platform I was going to fullfill my requirement as required in project completion. After long research I found Flutter, watch some video on youtube did some more research and finally decide to make our project using this tool(Flutter) using dark Language.

As I had no Knowledge about the flutter at that time, I did my best as much as possible.
Here are some screentshots of my application. You can find more in the project.
